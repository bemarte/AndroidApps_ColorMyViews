Within this simple app, some concepts in layout treatments are indexed, for example:

* Constrains
* Chaining
* Baseline Constrains

## Example of use
One way that these solutions can assist developers is by using:
* buttons that modify the format of other views
* text styles
* use of constraints

## Release history
